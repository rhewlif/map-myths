      "description": "Unrelated to its South American namesake, this legendary isle's name is thought to originate from the Uí Breasail (meaning 'descendants of Bresail'), one of the ancient clans of northeastern Ireland. Celtic folklore describes Hy Brasil as a place rarely seen, being permanently cloaked in mist except for one day every seven years. Ruled by King Breasal, the High King of the World, Hy Brasil was also said to be a wondrous paradise, offering eternal happiness and immortality.<br><br>Rumours of its existence were stoked further in 1675 by the publication of a satirical pamphlet by Richard Head that recounted the travels of the fictional Captain John Nisbet. Nisbet and his crew had stumbled upon the island <i>en route</i> to County Donegal from France, finding only an abandoned and half-demolished castle. That night, after the sailors had lit a fire, a '<i>very ancient grave Gentleman</i>' who spoke '<i>the old Scotch Language</i>' appeared, explaining that their presence had lifted a centuries-old spell that had rendered the island invisible. Nisbet was richly rewarded by the islanders and returned to Killybegs with many gifts of gold and silver. <br><br>Since its appearances on early 14th century maps, this rich and enduring mythology helped it to survive on maps for a further 500 years and well into the 19th century, latterly being downgraded to the more diminutive Brasil Rock."

Seeking to flee from their Muslim conquerors, seven Christian bishops escaped with their parishioners and set sail westwards, eventually landing on an island where they founded seven settlements within the island's bays.<br><br>By the 1490s there were rumours amongst Spanish and Portuguese sailors that silver and gold could be found in the island's sands.

On 15th century maps it is typically drawn as a large rectangular island, indented with bays and five or six settlements.<br><br>Loosely translated to 'Isle of Devils', historians have conjectured these 'devils' might be a reference to the Skrælings (indigenous peoples of Greenland and Vinland) reported in the Norse sagas that began to filter south around the 15th century.<br><br>Others have even conjectured that given its latitude, Satanazes may represent an early depiction of North America, and more specifically, Nova Scotia. In some maps, the island is labelled 'Ya de la man santanaxio', translated to 'Isle of the Hand of Satan'. In 1783 Vicenzo Formaleoni linked this name to the sea-faring legend of a giant hand that would drag sailors and boats to the bottom of the ocean. Satanazes disappeared from maps after the voyages of Christopher Columbus in the 1490s, with its legendary origin still unresolved today."

      "description": "The unexplored North Pole was a region of total mystery for early mapmakers. At the end of the 15th century, the first depictions of vast lands across the Arctic appeared on maps, which were predominantly based off the travels of a Franciscan friar in 1360. Writing on his 1507 map, Ruysch cited his source:<br><br>'<i>In the book De Inventione Fortunata it may be read that at the North Pole there is a <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Rupes Nigra\">high mountain of magnetic stone</a> 33 German miles in circumference. This is surrounded by mare sugunum which pours out water like a vessel through openings below. Around it are four islands, surrounded by extensive desolate mountains for 24 days’ journey, where there is no human habitation.</i>'<br><br>In Mercator's 1595 map of the Arctic, he even describes that one of the islands is <a href=\"https://arctic.rhewlif.xyz?x=3.62&y=-5.20&id=2\" target=\"_blank\">home to 4-feet tall pygmies</a>. As new discoveries in the High Arctic emerged, such as that of Spitsbergen in 1596, these lands had to be modified, and in later versions of Mercator's map the land of pygmies became much reduced. Over the next few decades, these rumoured conceptions of the Arctic, including the four countries, a large maelstrom, and a magnetic <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Rupes Nigra\">Rupes Nigra</a>, would vanish altogether from maps.",

      "description": "The Voyage of St Brendan and the island he discovered is a famous sea tale from Irish history that recounts a fantastic 7-year search for the 'Promised Land of the Saints' in AD 512. Written records of the voyage did not appear for another 300 years, so the details surrounding Brendan's odyssey are highly inconsistent. Nevertheless, St Brendan of Clonfert and his band of 14 monks wandered widely in search of the warm island and had many adventures.<br><br>According to legend, these included stumbling upon giant sea creatures, landing on an island that was actually a whale, discovering an island with sheep as large as oxen, and another with talking birds. They also came upon Judas Iscariot sitting on a rock in the middle of the sea, apparently on his annual respite from the torments of hell.<br><br>After 43 days at sea (records vary on this point), and with rations almost depleted, their ship finally reached the earthly paradise they were seeking, filled with beautiful fruits and abundant flowers, and where neither nocturnal darkness nor winter cold were known. For seven years the monks happily remained here, and made numerous visits to other nearby islands before returning home to their monastery in Clonfert.<br><br>St Brendan's destination was initially associated with the Canaries, particularly by the Spanish and Portuguese, though was later shifted by mapmakers once the attentions of explorers migrated north and westwards."

      "description": "Notions of a large sea dissecting North America stem back to the 1524 expedition by Giovanni da Verrazano that explored the region around Newfoundland. Beyond the Outer Banks of North Carolina Verrazano was able to see Pamlico Sound, the largest lagoon along the eastern coast of the US. He mistook the lagoon as being the Pacific Ocean and thus began the myth of the Sea of Verrazano. <br><br>By the 18th century, depictions of a large inland sea had reemerged based on separate (and dubious) accounts of exploration by Juan de Fuca and the fictional Bartholomew de Fonte. De Fuca had apparently journeyed up a vast strait at the northernmost point of America's west coast, around which he enjoyed '<i>sailing therein more than twenty days</i>'.<br><br>In 1703, Guillaume de L'Isle became the first to map these rumours more definitively, and by 1750 Philippe Buache had drawn 'La Mer de l'Ouest' to dominate the largely unexplored portions of northwest Canada. The tenacity of cartographers to keep depicting this 'Sea of the West' on more than 200 maps during the 18th century was no doubt compounded by economic interests in Europe for discovering a navigable trading route through North America. Subsequent charting of the Pacific Northwest coastline by James Cook, Vitus Bering and others dwindled prospects of finding a great sea by the end of the century."

      "description": "Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 marked the beginning of a lucrative gold rush for the Spanish, and by 1560 they had shipped 101 tons home from the New World. A legend arose of a fabulously rich king, El Dorado (The Gilded One) within the jungle heartland, who would ritually wash in Lake Guatavita to remove ornamental powdered gold from his body. The idea of El Dorado morphed from being a single man to a city, and even a kingdom.<br><br>Many searches ensued, and while the Spanish eventually became convinced of El Dorado's non-existence, Sir Walter Raleigh's arrival in Guyana in 1594 renewed enthusiasm for its search.<br><br>Raleigh conflated El Dorado with another lost city, Manoa, which he located on the legendary Lake Parime far up the Orinoco River in Venezuela. According to him, the lake itself was the source of the gold possessed by the people of Manoa. Explorers have since proposed that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah may have led to the misidentification of a lake."

This error can still be found in Google Earth with its sea-surface masking algorithm accounting for this second archipelago, even though the islands do not appear on satellite imagery.<br><br>The source of the error probably stems from a combination of the inclusion of Chinese raw data and the 'China GPS shift problem' - a class of issues that cause displacement between the Chinese GCJ-02 datum and the WGS-84 datum used by the Global Positioning System.

      "description": "When negotiations began in 1998 between the US and Mexico on how to delimit their exclusive economic zones in the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico's hopes for a more expansive territory lay on a small island - Bermeja - found on many historic charts going back to the 16th century.<br><br>With no physical evidence forthcoming for the island, the Clinton-Zedillo accords of 09 June 2000 were signed, and the borders were fixed. However, with an agreement to only begin oil drilling projects in 2011, there was still time to potentially find Bermeja and reverse the treaty. In 2009, three separately funded expeditions set out from Mexico to scour its supposed location, but each came back empty-handed. Had the island simply vanished?<br><br>Bermeja first appears on a portolan chart made by Gaspar Luis Viegas around 1535. Its coordinates at 23°N were later catalogued in <a href=\"https://bibliotecadigital.rah.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.do?path=1022533&presentacion=pagina&registrardownload=0&posicion=241\" target=\"_blank\">1537 by Alonso de Santa Cruz</a>, who also described the island as looking reddish from a distance. A few years later he would also include Bermeja in his <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/islario-general-de-todas-las-islas-del-mundo/page/n665/mode/1up?view=theater\" target=\"_blank\">1539 atlas</a>, <i>Islario general de todas las islas del mundo</i>.<br><br>Bermeja would persist on maps over the coming centuries despite no further sightings. The last Mexican government-printed schoolbook showing Isla Bermeja was released in 1946.<br><br>Explanations for its disappearance have ranged from rising sea levels to destruction by an earthquake. Yet a more radical suggestion was proposed by some Mexican lawmakers, notably José Ángel Conchello Dávila, who claimed it had been destroyed by the Central Intelligence Agency to nullify Mexican claims in the gulf. It is more probable that 16th-century reports had confused Bermeja with the Cayo Arenas reef nearby to the south."

Rumours of their existence were first heard by the Spanish pilot Francisco Gali from the Portuguese in Macao in 1582.<br><br>Finding these islands thus soon became of strategic importance for the Spanish, particularly as a potential safe harbour that their cargo-laden galleons could exploit during rough weather <i>en route</i> over the Pacific. This urgency increased once the isolationist foreign policy of the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate began in 1603, and which would last for the next 265 years. <br><br>Experienced explorers, including Tasman, Cook, and de Vries would search for the islands over the next few centuries. A reported sighting of Rica de Plata by Captain Crespo in 1801 helped to keep the islands on 19th century maps, with Rica de Plata lingering through onto Bartholomew's Times Survey Atlas of 1922."

      "description": "Cloate's Island was the name given to Point Cloates on the Australian mainland when it was erroneously sighted and assumed to be a separate island. The mistake can be traced back to 1719 when Captain Nash (possibly an Englishman) of the Flemish ship <i>House of Austria</i> spotted a ~50 km-long 'island' while <i>en route</i> from Ostend in Belgium to China. He named the island after one of the owners of the vessel, quite possibly an anglicisation of the Flemish surname Cloot.<br><br>A similar sighting of land was made by the ship <i>Haeslingfield</i> in 1743, though a difference in longitudinal distance of ~7° from the Cape of Good Hope between these two accounts meant the position of Cloate's Island remained uncertain.<br><br>This confusion led some 18th century cartographers to place the island at around 95°E - more than 1600 km from today's Point Cloates, leading to its eventual classification as a phantom island."

However, when the Mongol Empire collapsed and Prester John's kingdom remained undiscovered, attention turned to Ethiopia instead, which was already well known as a powerful Christian land.<br><br>By the time Ethiopian Emperor, Lebna Dengel, and the Portuguese had established diplomatic contact with each other in 1520, Prester John was the unofficial name by which Europeans referred to the Emperor.<br><br>European academics of the 17th century began to prove that no such lineage connected Prester John to the Ethiopian monarchs, and the search for the fabled king gradually ceased. Despite being consigned to lore, Prester John continued to inspire writers ranging from William Shakespeare through to the modern Marvel and DC comics."

W. end is a high bluff of about 70 feet, perpendicular form, and runs along to the south-east about 8 miles. You will see trees at about a mile and a half distance, and a sandy beach.'</i><br><br>Many of those who searched for the island in vain instead mentioned deceptive cloud formations; in 1809 Captain James Horsburgh wrote:<br><br>'<i>About this place I have seen clouds, exactly like land, remain stationary at the horizon for a great length of time; a superficial observer might have taken a view, and asserted that it was an island.</i>'<br><br>The infamous Benjamin Morrell (see also <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Byer's Island\">Byer's</a> & <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Morrell's Island\">Morrell's</a> islands) also made efforts to find Saxemberg Island in 1828, though even this search was shown to be another one of his fabrications, presumably to enliven an otherwise unremarkable voyage across the South Atlantic."

The ambiguous location of these islands thus morphed into a partly mythologized generic name for sources of tin beyond the Mediterranean in the far West.<br><br>Later, when the West was better explored, it was found that tin actually came from two regions: Galicia, in the northwest of the Iberia, and Devon and Cornwall in southwest England. The Isles of Scilly thus became a candidate for the legendary Cassiterides, although no tin is found there today.<br><br>Modern-day attempts to locate these islands suggest they may have been situated off the coast of Brittany, between Paimboeuf and St Nazaire - a region that has now silted up to form the marshes of the Brière."

The island of Fonseca was initially chosen, but since it could not be found, they instead sailed to Providencia Island and founded a settlement there.<br><br>The name 'Ysla de Fonte Seca' (Island of the Dry Fountain) first appears on Hondius' world map in 1595, northeast of the Orinoco delta. Though it was previously known as 'San Bernardo', appearing as early as 1544 on the world map drawn by Sebastian Cabot.<br><br>Shrouded in mystery, fictional accounts of the island's discovery surfaced late in the 17th century, with one describing it as a colony of Welsh Amazon women who worshipped the moon. A second described it as a foul and immoral hellhole where rampant drinking, gambling and promiscuity were encouraged.<br><br>Various hypotheses have been put forward for the fancied existence of Fonseca, including discoloured waters discharged from the Orinoco, and poor longitudinal positioning of early Spanish discoveries in the Lesser Antilles. Soundings taken in 1852 by the American brig <i>Dolphin</i> revealed water depths of 4700 m, conclusively ending the Fonseca myth."

Many legends were subsequently written about the island. These included reports of ants as large as mastiffs that harvested gold, and inhabitants known as the Sciapodes that had one giant foot that could be used to shade themselves from the noon sun. <br><br>Ancient Sri Lankan chronicles describe a kingdom named Tambapanni. According to the chronicles Prince Vijaya landed on an island named Lanka after he was exiled from India. Prince Vijaya ruled the island from 543 BC to 505 BC and named it Tambapanni. It is thus theorized that the name Taprobana was a Greek or Roman alteration of Tambapanni, and that the Taprobana known to the ancient Greeks is thus most certainly Sri Lanka. However, for a brief time in the 16th century some mapmakers mis-associated the name instead with Sumatra."

Estotiland was described as very fertile and had mountains inland. The king of this country possessed books written in Latin, though he did not understand them. <br><br>This king had persuaded the fishermen to visit another land to the south called Drogeo, though they found only strange beasts and cannibals, from whom they escaped only after teaching them how to fish. Zichmi, the king of Frisland, ordered Antonio Zeno to find these new lands, though he discovered only <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Icaria\">Icaria</a> instead. <br><br>While the Zeno account is now considered a fabrication, the supposed country of Estotiland was commonly placed in the area of Labrador on maps until c. 1660.

William Dampier, who was on the same ship as Cowley in 1684, published his own account of the voyage in 1697.

In some instances it is also depicted as flowing underground for 60 miles before emerging in Lake Borno, or being connected to the Nile, borrowing from ideas written by Pliny.<br><br>In reality, the Niger River flows eastwards from the Guinea Highlands in West Africa before curving south and emptying in the Gulf of Guinea.<br><br>The notion of a 'Nigir' river extends far back to the classical writings of Ptolemy, who mentions this as one of two rivers in the Sahara. Yet, as with all early maps of the African continent, a lack of accurate information on its interior allowed many errors to perpetuate. That the third-longest river in Africa flowed in a reverse direction is one particularly egregious example.<br><br>By the mid-18th century the source of the Niger was becoming more accurately depicted, with the river flowing in the correct direction at least but with an unknown outlet. It would not be until 1830 that its geography would be confirmed to Europeans, when Richard Lander and his brother became the first to follow the course of the Niger to the ocean."

Among them was Sarah Anne Island (4°0'N, 154°22'W), claimed by the United States Guano Company under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. This law enabled any US citizen to take possession of unclaimed and uninhabited islands containing guano deposits.<br><br>With its rich nitrogen and phosphates, guano was not just a resource, but a potential goldmine. It could be used to produce highly profitable agricultural fertilisers, and it was a source of saltpeter for gunpowder. The Guano Islands Act led to the US gaining control of around 94 islands. By 1903, 66 of these islands were recognised as territories of the US.<br><br>A 1933 review of the Guano Islands Act claims found no evidence that the island was ever mined. Furthermore, the report noted that no island could be found at the reported coordinates of 4°0'N, 154°22'W.<br><br>Later searches, including by the US Pacific Fleet, which intended to build an observatory there to observe the solar eclipse of 1937, found nothing. At the time, it was suggested that the island had sunk. Yet a more rational explanation is that Sarah Ann Island was, in fact, the very real Malden Island at almost identical coordinates in the southern hemisphere, sighted and named by the whaler <i>Sarah Ann</i> around 1825. Its migration north of the equator first appears on an 1836 map by J.W. Norrie, presumably due to a misreading of its original coordinates.",

Upon reaching the western coast of Cape York (south of Carpentaria), Janzsoon travelled northwards charting the Australian coastline for ~320 km, believing it to be land connected to New Guinea.<br><br>Luís Vaz de Torres had actually passed through the strait between New Guinea and Australia in 1606. However, the Spanish had suppressed his report in the hopes of maintaining power via geographic secrecy. The strait was only rediscovered by Alexander Dalrymple (the first Hydrographer of the British Admiralty) in 1762 when he was researching documents captured from the Spanish in the Philippines during the Seven Years’ War.<br><br>Cook's arrival and charting of the east coast of 'New Holland' in 1770 - the only major part of the continent having not yet been charted by the Dutch - effectively ended any further speculation of a land connection with New Guinea."

Bouvet was not able to land here, nor circumnavigate his discovery, so its status as an island would not be confirmed until 1808.

Rather than a massive continent <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Terra Australis\">as had been commonly depicted on earlier maps</a>, Buache speculated that this land was instead split in two and separated by a frozen inland sea.<br><br>Buache first presented these ideas to the Académie des Sciences in 1744, which led to much discussion amongst geographers at the time.

His hypotheses included ice-free and navigable waters across the Arctic kept open by the Gulf Stream, phantom land masses such as <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#Giles Land\">Giles Land</a>, and an extended Greenland reaching across the pole to Wrangel Island. Despite his scientific missteps, he remained an influential and prominent supporter of German polar exploration. <br><br>The mapping of these non-existent islands by Payer confused Fridtjof Nansen when he and Hjalmar Johansen in 1895 struggled south on the sea ice towards Franz Josef Land after having attempted to reach the North Pole. Further proof of its non-existence came in 1914 when the Russian schooner <i>St. Anna</i> drifted through the assumed coordinates of the island.

The Greek geographer, Ptolemy, later used this account to produce the first maps depicting these 'Mountains of the Moon'.<br><br>The myth continued for centuries, with little information to otherwise contradict Ptolemy. The 1700 map of Africa by Guillaume de L'Isle, a cartographer known for his scientific approach, became one of the first to reject these 2nd-century interpretations and correctly identified the source of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. The source of the White Nile was later definitively determined as Lake Victoria by Henry Morton Stanley in 1874, finally laying this myth to rest.<br><br>But which mountains had Diogenes visited? While his landing port of Rhapta is now lost, the Rwenzori Mountains between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, peaking at 5109 m, are the most probable candidate."

      "description": "Around the mid-17th century an unusually large island under variations of the name 'San Juan' started to appear regularly on maps off the northeast corner of Mindanao in the Philippines. Its very first appearance, though, can be traced back to 1570 to Abraham Ortelius' map of Asia. The island is recognisable today as Siargao, the sighting of which was first recorded in 1543 by Bernardo de la Torre on board the <i>San Juan de Letrán</i>. De la Torre was also the first European to circumnavigate Mindanao, and in general, added a great deal to European knowledge of the Philippines.<br><br>The myth, however, also surrounds the size of the island as it started to balloon in size over the centuries, almost as large as its neighbour Mindanao in some cases. Its speculative nature was sufficient that by the start of the 19th century its existence was being marked as doubtful on some charts, or was dropped altogether. By the mid-19th century, it would still sometimes appear on charts alongside its counterpart of Surigao, though with a much diminished size."

Yet this myth only began to appear on maps many decades after its discovery and initial charting in 1533.<br><br>The earliest known mention of an 'Island of California' comes from a ~1510 romance novel <i>Las sergas de Esplandián</i> (The deeds of the Esplandián), which described an island west of the Indies, and <i>'...very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons'</i>.<br><br>Following Hernán Cortés' conquest of Mexico he sent several expeditions out to sea during the 1530s in search of this paradise, leading Fortun Ximenez to become the first European to sight Baja California. Later in 1539, Francisco de Ulloa tracked northwards to the mouth of the Colorado River, and proved the peninsula was not an island. And so after 1541, California began to appear on maps correctly attached to the mainland. <br><br>But in 1622, the earliest surviving map of California as an island appeared by Michiel Colijn of Amsterdam - a mythical reinvention that would last through until the latter half of the 18th century. This reimagining is thought to have originated from descriptions fabricated by Friar Antonio de la Ascension that were seized from the Spanish by Dutch pirates in 1620, and which quickly landed in Dutch cartographers' hands. The misconception spread as mapmakers copied what they considered as reputable information provided by the Dutch.<br><br>In 1747 Ferdinand VI of Spain eventually issued a decree, declaring that '<i>California is not an island</i>'."

Uncertainty of what lay beyond this limit of exploration of the <a href=\"https://arcticfog.rhewlif.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\">Northeast Passage</a> would confound cartographers for the next century.<br><br>Already in 1604 Ortelius speculated that the Novaya Zemlya was not in fact an island, but was instead firmly attached to the continental mainland to the east. In 1687 the name 'Jelmer Land' first appeared on a map approximately in the location of the Gyda Peninsula on the mainland today.<br><br>According to its creator, Nicolaas Witsen, the name derived from its discovery in 1664 by Captain Willem de Vlamingh. At the age of 24, de Vlamingh had sailed around the northeast hook of Novaya Zemlya down to ~74°N, where he saw all the signs of land. Some of his crew even thought land could be seen, and so the coastline was named after the ship's bosun, Cornelis Jelmersz Kok.<br><br>This <i>Terre de Jelmer</i> revived these older cartographic notions of a land bridge connecting northern Novaya Zemlya to the Taymyr Peninsula and was briefly re-incorporated onto maps. That was until systematic mapping of the Siberian Arctic coast from 1733-1743 by the Russian Great Northern (Second Kamchatka) Expedition greatly reduced many of the uncertainties surrounding these 'white areas' on maps."

The expedition started badly with Willoughby and a second ship becoming separated in storms off northern Norway. However, the third ship under the command of Richard Chancellor continued on to discover the entrance to the White Sea. After landing at the mouth of the Dvina River, Chancellor was summoned to Moscow where he negotiated a trade agreement with Ivan the Terrible that would last 300 years.<br><br>Willoughby was never seen alive again. His journal was later recovered though which helped to piece together events after their separation. For two weeks the ships had sailed eastward until they encountered an uninhabited shoreline teeming with ducks and other birds. This was likely Gusinaya Zemlya (Goose Land) - a peninsula of Yuzhny Island, Novaya Zemlya. From here they turned back westward until they reached the Kola Peninsula. Here they were forced to overwinter, though unfortunately, no-one survived the Arctic cold.<br><br>Willoughby's Land would later be used by the English to support a claim for Spitsbergen prior to its discovery by the Dutch in 1596, though given their latitudes it seems likely Willougby's discoveries are a transposition of the two islands of Novaya Zemlya."

They did find land, probably Greenland, but returned to Iceland after a harsh winter.<br><br>The widely accepted discoverer of Greenland though is Eirik the Red, as documented in the Icelandic sagas. In 982, he likewise sailed out from Iceland to seek the skerries, and ended up establishing settlements on the southwestern tip of the Greenland.<br><br>Once Greenland was discovered the skerries largely disappeared from history, only reappearing via occasional sightings, including (based on accounts written in 1625) from the mountain of Ritur in northwestern Iceland. Their disappearance, according to Ruysch's 1507 map, was from being 'completely burned up' in 1456, i.e. were destroyed by a volcanic eruption. A more realistic interpretation though is that Gunnbjörn's Skerries were a mirage image of Greenland's Blosseville Coast.<br><br>Today, Gunnbjörn Ulfsson lends his name to Gunnbjørn Fjeld - the highest mountain in Greenland and the same peak he likely saw over 1000 years ago."

The island of Hvitsarc and its compass otherwise seems to be a story devised by Magnus' imagination; the real Hvítserkur is a 15 m high basalt stack that can be found along the eastern shore of the Vatnsnes peninsula, in northwest Iceland."

The origins of the lake name are unknown, but the Portuguese explorer Fernão Mendes Pinto who travelled in Thailand and Burma in the 1540s described Chiang Mai:<br><br><i>And in the middle of this country or kingdom, which is what it was formally, there is a big lake the natives call Cunebeté, though others call it the Chiang Mai. That lake empties into this river and three other rivers besides, that provide water for a great part of the land. The writers who have described it state that the lake measures sixty jaus in circumference with three leagues to a jau [i.e. ~1000 km in circumference], and that all around it there are many mines of silver, copper, tin and lead, which are in constant production and yield huge quantities of these metals...</i><br><br>The prominence of Lake Chiamay shrank on European maps as exploration of the Asian interior filtered back, particularly thanks to knowledge obtained by the Jesuits. It ultimately disappeared from new maps entirely after 1751."

      "description": "That the southern hemisphere should contain a giant counterweight continent is a notion that goes back to the ancient Greeks. Aristotle remarked, '<i>..there must be a region bearing the same relation to the southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole, it will clearly correspond in the ordering of the winds as well as in other things.</i>' The sighting of Tierra del Fuego to the south by Ferdinand Magellan in 1520 as he rounded South America seemingly corroborated this idea. The new discoveries of New Guinea in 1528 and New Zealand in 1642 were, too, initially considered to be possible evidence for the continent.<br><br>The included protrusion of a 'Province of Beach/Boeach' from this continent in the region of New Guinea stems from mis-transcriptions of a name written by Marco Polo in his description of a journey taken by sea from China to India. Polo mistakenly described his route departing southward from Java instead of Champa (Vietnam), thus mis-locating the lands he actually visited far to the south. These included Locach (Lop Buri), which in German cursive script looks vey similar to Boeach.<br><br>James Cook's voyages of 1768-1771 and 1772-75 finally destroyed any notion of the continent through his circumnavigation of New Zealand and vast sweeps of the southern Pacific. In 1814, Matthew Flinders published <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis</i> which popularised arguments for dismissing the notion of a great southern continent and assigning the name instead to New Holland (Australia). The official name switch was completed in 1824 by the colonial authorities in Sydney, only four years after the frozen shores of Antarctica were sighted for the very first time in 1820."

It was covered with birds and the sea swarmed with seal and sea elephants'.</i><br><br>The island raised its head once more during the first official visit of a Japanese ambassador to the United States during 1859-60. During their transoceanic navigation, low land and breakers were spotted causing a brief diversion. As the weather cleared it became apparent they had been deceived. A final search organised by San Francisco merchants in 1867 found only 'discoloured water' resembling a shallow bank."

The city of Bega was three-quarters of a mile long and had many streets wider than those of London.

      "description": "San Pedro persisted on maps for over 300 years, first appearing during the age of Spanish explorations of the Pacific. Yet who or when this atoll was discovered remains an enigma.<br><br>Abraham Ortelius was the first to map this archipelago in 1587, naming it on his map of the Americas as 'Y de S. Y<sup>e</sup>'. Two years later Oretlius included the island group again on a map of the Pacific, calling it 'Y de S. Y<sup>o</sup>'.<br><br>By 1594 Plancius had renamed this distinctive ciruclar island group to I. de S. Petro and the name stuck for the next three centuries.<br><br><a href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/jv239xf4087\" target=\"_blank\">According to Guillaume De L'Isle</a> the island had been discovered by Olivier van Noort in 1600. However, van Noort's only stop in the Pacific during his circumnavigation of the globe <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/wonderlijckevoya00noor/page/35/mode/1up?q=%22de+los+ladrones%22\" target=\"_blank\">was in Guam</a>, or Isla de los Ladrones as it had been named by Magellan in 1521.<br><br>No logs from the many Spanish galleons crossing the Pacific during the 16th century appear to have named an island San Pedro in this region either. What was Ortelius' source then?<br><br>The closest known discovery is the island of <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#san-bartholome\">San Bartholomé</a> in 1526. Some early maps had simply labelled this atoll with the warning 'abreojo' ('open eye' in Spanish). Had Ortelius simply misread this label from a source map when updating his 1587 map with 'Y de S. Y<sup>e</sup>'? Continuing the communication breakdown, was Ortelius' label then in turn reinterpreted as I de S. Pedro? The case remains open.<br><br>Recorded efforts to visit this island came in the 19th century. Its assumed position <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/narrativeofuni05wilk/page/271/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">was passed over by Samuel Knox of the US Exploring Expedition in 1841</a> but no indications of it were found."

      "description": "The first appearance of Albion Island on maps coincides with a rivalry between the French and English on who would be the first to publish the first chart of Australia's full coastline.<br><br>At the start of the 19th century, maps of Australia were still incomplete. Therefore, when in 1802 the English whaling ship <i>Albion</i> reported a new island around 38°20'S, 139°40'E off the southern coastline, there was little information to verify or deny the claim. In fact, it corroborated another recent sighting by Robert Turnbull of the whaler Britannia on a voyage out of Port Jackson during thick fog.<br><br>During this same year, two expeditions were sailing around Australia - one French, led by Nicolas Baudin, and the other English, led by Matthew Flinders. Despite the two nations being in the midst of war, Flinders and Baudin exchanged details of their discoveries when they met in Encounter Bay. Flinders would go on to become the first person to circumnavigate Australia.<br><br>Yet this goodwill between rival nations did not last long. During Flinders' return to England, his ship required urgent repairs on the French-held island of Mauritius. Yet the French governor was suspicious of his alleged scientific mission and imprisoned Flinders on the island for six years. This detainment gave Louis de Freycinet of France sufficient time to publish in 1811 the first map of Australia showing its full coastline.<br><br>It is on this map that the rumoured Albion Island first appears, albeit nameless, off the coast of what had been named 'Terre Napoleon'. Flinders would go on to publish his own chart in 1814 - which adopted the first use of the term 'Australia' - and also included Albion Island, with the simple annotation of 'uncertain'.<br><br>Despite Albion Island being quickly disproved by Dr David Reid of the convict transport <i>Baring</i> in 1815, Albion Island would continue appearing on maps into the early 20th century. <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/163161847?searchTerm=Albion%20island\" target=\"_blank\">Newspaper reports</a> from the 1920s suggest Albion Island was probably a mirage after a similar occurrence had been witnessed from the Great Australian Bight."

The story is set in Tile (Thule) - the furthest isle of the world inhabited with men.<br><br>When the Christian king of this isle fell sick and was on his deathbed, St. Thomas of Canterbury appeared to him in a vision, instructing him to build a church dedicated to him.

While on the search for new land, Nicolo Zeno discovered a monastery of the order of Friars Preachers (Dominicans) and a church dedicated to Saint Thomas, '<i>...hard by a hill which vomited fire like Vesuvius and Etna</i>'. The narrative further explained how springs of hot water allowed the monks to live comfortably here in the harsh conditions of this northerly latitude.<br><br>The Thomas referenced by the later Zeno narrative implies the church was dedicated to St. Thomas Aquinas, canonized in 1323, rather than St. Thomas of Canterbury (Thomas Becket) referenced in Mandeville's Travels and who was canonized in 1173.<br><br>Some have hypothesised the monastery still stands today, not in Greenland but as Newport Tower in Rhode Island.

Instead, they had come across the volcanic island of Niuafoʻou in Tonga (15°36'S, 175°38'W). This island had been visited previously in 1791 by the British Capt. Edwards, who had <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22834/22834-h/22834-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\">reported the natives calling it Onooasaw</a>. Furthermore, the observation of removed finger parts can be related to a pre-Christian tradition in Tonga that occurred during periods of mourning."

Left stranded by a storm 200-300 leagues (1,287-1,931 km) northeast of the Molucca Passage, Diego da Rocha came across a group of inhabited islands where they recuperated for the next few months. He named the islands after his pilot: Ihla de Gomes de Sequeira.<br><br>Some contemporary accounts placed the islands at a latitude of 9 or 10 degrees north.

The Spanish captain Don Joaquín Lafita of the frigate <i>Príncipe de Asturias</i> reported these to be 'discoveries from ancient times' that had been noted on old Spanish charts, namely Martires (Pulap), Matalotes (Fais/Ngulu) and Cafrifan (unknown). Were these the islands da Roche had visited too?<br><br>No islands were ever found at the coordinates confidently provided by Lafita and eventually these names disappeared from maps entirely. However, the legend of the Sequeiras islands persisted on maps through the 19th century. More recently, <a href=\"https://micronesica.org/sites/default/files/the_portuguese_discovery_of_the_isles_of_sequeira_by_lessa_w.a._-micronesica_vol.11_no.1_jul._1975_o.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">it has been speculated</a> that da Rocha had actually reached Ulithi atoll - the westernmost of the Caroline Islands."
